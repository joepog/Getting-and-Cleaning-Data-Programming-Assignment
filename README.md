* 1, download and unzip the data file into your R working directory.
* 2, download R source code into your R working directory.
* 3, execute R source code to generate tidy data file.

### Description of Data
The variables in X are sensor signals from waist-mounted smartphones from 30 subjects. The variable in Y indicates activity type.

### Explaination of R code
The code combined training dataset with test dataset, extracted partial variables to create a dataset with averages of each variable for each activity.

### Combined dataset
The new generated dataset contained variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row is an average of each activity type for all subjects.
